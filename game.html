            <h1>Musical Madness</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Musical Madness is a Role-Playing Game believed to have been released around the end of the Gameboy Advance's lifespan, sometime within the last year before Nintendo stopped production on the handheld. The mysteries surrounding the game are great, and for a time around its release it was hard to go anywhere on the internet without hearing some talk about it. By far the biggest mystery although would have to be about who exactly produced the game, as although the publisher (bieng Nintendo) is present on the boxart for the game, the developers, both in logo and in name, aren't present anywhere on the box or cartridge art. This has led many to believe that the game was produced by Nintendo devs that perhaps went rogue and made their own game during production of another game (or games) that were being made during the last year or so before Nintendo stopped production on the Gameboy Advance, and left out their names or group name for fear of being recognized and perhaps even losing their jobs. The other major theory is that the game was developed by a small team that Nintendo had partnered with sometime a year prior to the game's announcement, and that the small team ended up perhaps making some bad financial choices and ended up bankrupt in the process which had left a bad taste in the mouth of Nintendo's lead Game Director and Founder, Shigeru Miyamoto; although why this would lead to the any record of the game's developer team being wiped from any and all promotional material surrounding the game is not understandable.</p>
            <p>Of what is still around of the game's promotional material these days, the game seemed to heavily revolve around or focus on Music as a major element of both the game's world and plot, with characters using various instruments as weaponry, with some even having an instrument as their head, or perhaps a helmet or hat. Players would choose from One of Five characters to use as their main character, and go on an adventure to stop the so-called "Mayhem Maestro" from taking away the musical charm from the world of the game. As players would get further on in the game, they would be able to acquire a party of up to Four different characters to fight alongside with, counting their Main Character, meaing there would always be one character of the main Five that you wouldn't get to play with in a playthrough, unless there were to be a party-swapping mechanic that was never advertised in any promotional material.</p>
            <h1>The Search</h1>
            <p>Musical Madness, when first released, was reported to supposedly be on store shelves for about 3 days, before all copies were pulled. This immediately led to many people to speculate why the game was pulled, and why it was pulled so quickly, although to this day there is no consise reasoning as to why this is. As people got more skeptical, it led to them taking more drastic measures in an attempt to find any and all copies of the game. The rampant searching ended however, when young 27 year-old male Johnny Truant had done some dumpster diving in the back of his local game store in an attempt to find a copy of Musical Madness, when the nearby Garbage Truck that was going along its route had picked up the dumpster he was in, and dumped him into the truck's compactor. After this incident, search for the game quickly died down and the few that remained diligent to find the game took to online forms, many of which, if not all of them, are now defunct in this day and age. As time went on, the search for a copy of Musical Madness and the hopes that there were any copies left died down, until eventually the game went almost completely forgotten, spare for a few people going on to tell the tales of how they'd spent hundreds of hours searching for any physical proof of the game aside from any promotional material such as magazine ads or commercials that had ran often once the game had been announced.</p>
            <h1>The Surviving Copy</h1>
            <p>Early on in the year 2024, an anonymous collector going by the handle of RetroGameist (@games4life) had started an account on X (formerly Twitter) and began to post picutres and videos of his numerous retro games and other such goods in his collection. After about a month of doing this, however, he posted a cryptic message about showing off the prize gem of his collection in a week's time. Many people began to guess what it could possibly be, but none were ready for what it ended up being:</p>
            <p>The collector had in his possesion, what is believed to be the only surviving copy of Musical Madness.</p>
            <p>This first post, as well of the future posts the collector would go on to make about the game for the next 6 days, sent many into a frenzy, which is completely understandable due to just how sought after a copy of Musical Madness once was, only for the supposedly only remaining copy of the game to appear on some random Twitter account all these years later, long after the original hype surrounding this enigma of a game had died down. Many people began to speculate how this collector had ended up with a copy of Musical Madness in his possesion, with many believing he might have even been a part of the game's dev team. The collector, however, would never answer such questions. The only questions he would answer were questions related to the game, and even then the responses given were usually quite vague, responding to questions such as "How is the gameplay?" asked by Twitter user @CozmicKit_ with an answer like "It plays like a GBA RPG, what'd you expect?", and the question "I need to know how the music is if it's practically the game's selling point" asked by Twitter user @ThyBakedBean with "It's definetely GBA-Era music.". As most would expect, this led many people to become irritated, as not only was the collector being extremely secretive about the game, but also that he said he was going to post about Musical Madness for only a week, before he would proceed to focus on other games and only ever bring up Musical Madness on rare occasion from then on out. By the end of the week, although some were thankful for finally showing off some imagery and footage of the game, many users were furious, and they made it clear with such responses as "That's it? 4 screenshots, 2 pictures of the boxart and cartridge, and only 1 measly 10-second clip of gameplay? That's all we get after all these years? What a waste.", commented by Twitter user @DeluxeLuigi_. Many people had began demanding that the collector dump the ROM online so that other people could playthe game, believing he was being greedy and keeping the game to himself. Others believed it would be best for him to keep the copy to himself to make sure it stays preserved for years to come and not get lost once again. However, only 24 hours after the collector had announced that the week of posting about Musical Madness was over, he had made another post, with an image that had greatly shook many users:</p>
            <img 
            <p>The collector had buried the game at an unknown set of coordinates, for anyone else to find. The game was, once again, lost to time.</p>
            <h1>What has become of Musical Madness</h1>

            <footer>
            <p>To this day, no-one has been able to find the now-buried, sole-surviving copy of Musical Madness, and if someone has, then they haven't posted anything about it, possibly for fear of being shunned or berated just like the collector who had somehow got his hands on the game before them. Musical Madness most likely is, and always will be, lost to time, never to be found.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, lost to the ages.</p>
