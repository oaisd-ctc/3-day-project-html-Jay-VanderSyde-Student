        <h3>HEllo ,welcome to ConspiristsUnited and for todays topic we have:</h3>
        <h2>MUSICAL MADNESS ADN ITS CONNECTIONS TO THE  MALLOW</h2>
        <p>Now whaat does this all mean? im VERY glad yuo asked, we're about to go down a massive rabbithole so i sugest you strap in and prepare yourslef for the most shocking consspiracy theory this side of the Midwest!</p>
        <h4>CONNECTION #1</h4>
       <h1>BOTH START WITH AN <em>M</em>!! !</h1>
       <p>Now that seems like a very  obvouis connection right folks? Well not many peiple would think of it, not at all as a matter of fact! The very idea that both Musical Madness and  just so happen to share an <em>M</em> in there names IS'NT just a COINCIDENCE! IT IS 101% INTENTIONAL!</p>
       <h3>CONNECTION# 2</h3>
       <h3>ThE COMMERCIALS</h3>
       <p>Now, I have a VHS recording of an old TV special of a sow I used to watchh when I was quite young; I decided to pull out the recordin g  recently for a bit of <em>Nostalgia</em> when I realised something very intruiging,,.</p>
       <h1> A COMMERCIAL FOR MARSHMALLOWS WOULD PLAY AFTER EVERY ADD FOR MUSICAL MAdneSS!!1!</h1>
       <p>CLEARLY this cannot be coincidental;, this has to be on puirpose, some sort of sumbliminal massaging or something by the coorperate masterminds running the TVs! To get us to Buy Music Madness and to get us to think of marshmallowes whenever we play or see the game!! it is all ONE BIG SCHEME to get customers to buy up more of those horrid shugary globs whenever we go out to shop for healthy foods and whatnot at the grociery stores!</p>
       <h1>h1 CONNECTION # 3? ?!</h1>
       <p>STay with ME herg, Their are some i n thre  gAME!!! They are little blobs jusrt wandering ROund in theb ackgornd, and theu lokk jsutr = like the recration phtos!</p>
       <p>Its not jsut the marshamllowd in tghe gamre though!!! THERE ARE MUSIC NOTES on the offical WeBsite for the stupdi blobs!!!</p>
       <h2>CoNNECTION 4</h2>
       <h5><a href= "https://m.youtube.com/shorts/1msRA6Ci-co">THIS VIdeO</a></h5>
       <p>And whith that, there is all the evidance youll ever need to know FOR A FACT that these two things are indeed conected! I rest my case.</p>
