                <p>There once was a world made of sugar, gelatin and water. It was a small and rather sweet world, filled with candy cane forests, sugar grass meadows and jelly-like rivers and lakes. A variety of living creatures exist in this fantastical world, all suited to their environment. Sugar arctic foxes, Peppermint Penguins and Rock Candy Rabbits inhabit the Northern regions. Gelatinous Jellyfish and Sour Salmon take charge of the waters. Carmel Chameleons, Sprinkle Squirrels, Licorice Lizards and a variety of other Candy Critters filled the rest of the land. However, one creature stuck out more than any other, the Mallows. </p>
                <p>The Mallow were highly intelligent beings, capable of building temporary villages and domesticating other Candy Critters. They are familiar based nomadic groups given the tempermental season changes of the sweet planet. Mallows had a preferance for vegetarian-based food sources, but would turn to hunting in desperate, dry environments. While pacifistic in nature, they did require defenses against Heat Monsters, the only known predators to Mallows. This means they usually made camp in forest canopies and igloos up North. Meadows were usually avoided due to how vulnerable they would be to attack.</p>
                <p>Mallows were very soft and squishy, making them adept to climbing. They came many different shapes, sizes and colors. Often being cylindrical in form and adapting a multitude of pastel colors that change depending on diet and environment.</p>
                <p>Each group included an elder pair and their direct decendents ranging from 2-4 generations. During the Autumn months, all groups would travel to the rainforests near the equator to prepare for the next generations. When all meeting the other groups, the recently matured generation picks a mate and create a confectonary seed to plant in the rich soil of the forest. In the Spring, the seeds become flowers that reveals the newest generation to the rest of the Mallows. After their offspring sprout, the new pair leave to form their own group or if there is enough space, stay with the orginal group.</p>
                <p>Truly a fascinating world.</p>
